Lab 3: Variables in Data types

In this lab you will define or declare 3 variables of types:
int, float, and char in the provided variables.c program located
in c_playground.

Learning Objects
  You should be able to:
  1. Understand how do define a variable
  2. Understand how to assign a value to a variable
  
Instructions:
Define 3 variables

1. Open variables.c located in c_playground with a text editor
2. define 3 variables of data type int, float, and char
3. assign any permitted or legal value to the three variables you defined.
4. Save the program 
5. open the terminal(on the desktop)
6. compile the program variables.c with gcc by typing:
     gcc variables.c
   -If the program compiles copy the text and send it to me (andrew) in a private message on zoom
   -You are done with the lab
7. If the program fails to compile fix the syntax errors and repeat steps 2-6
   -Check that you variable names/labels are valid, the data is valid (review 
    slide 6), and that you have semicolons “;” at the end of every line





Once you program(variables.c) compiles and you have sent it to 
me with a private message on zoom your lab is done.
