Lab 2: Introduction to C

The comment character in c which is: "//" tells the compiler not to compile a line.
This allows a programmer to add notes, descriptions, and otherwise document 
in-line with the source code.

Learning Objects
  You should be able to:
  1. Correct a syntax error(lab2.c will not compile until you correct this)
  2. Correct a semantic errors
  3. Use the comment character "//"
  
Instructions:
  1. Open the lab2.c file in a text editor
  2. Fix the syntax error and compile lab2.c
  3. Fix BOTH semantic errors.
  3. Compile lab2.c and run it.
  4. Once your output looks exactly like the output below the lab is done.

The lab 2 program should print the numbers 1-10.
Once you have corrected the syntax and semantic 
errors the output should look EXACTLY like the 
following:
