Lab 2: Introduction to C

The comment character in c which is: "//" tells the compiler not to compile a line.
This allows a programmer to add notes, descriptions, and otherwise document 
in-line with the source code.

Learning Objects
  You should be able to:
  1. Correct a syntax error(lab2.c will not compile until you correct this)
  2. Correct a semantic errors
  3. Use the comment character "//"
  
Instructions:
  1. Open the lab2.c file in a text editor (located in the c_playground directory/folder)
  2. Fix the syntax error and compile lab2.c
     -open the terminal(on the desktop)
     -type the "ls" and hit the enter key to list all files in the directory
     -compile the lab2 program lab2.c with gcc by typing:
      gcc hello_world.c
     -fix syntax error repeat this process.
     -once lab2.c compiles WITHOUT ERRORS run it after it has been compiled by 
     typing :
      ./a.out
     HINT: you must hit the "ENTER/RETURN" key after every command to execute it
  3. Fix BOTH semantic errors.
     -repeat step 2. until all semantic errors are fixed.
  4. Once your output looks exactly like the output below the lab is done.

The lab 2 program should print the numbers 1-10.
Once you have corrected the syntax and semantic 
errors the output should look EXACTLY like the 
following:

OUTPUT
Hello, Lab#2!

i: 2
i: 3
i: 4
i: 5
