Lab 7: Functions


Write a program that uses a function to calculate the sum of two integers

Requirements:
    Your program must have two functions defined and a main function
        The first function should print “Hello, World!”
        The second function should accept two integer values and add them together and return the value

Example Output:

Hello, World
A: 33, B: 12
A + B = 45

Hint: use the example programs located in c_playground called function.c and function_2.c as help.
