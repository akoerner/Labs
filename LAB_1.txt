Lab 1 Welcome to C

In this lab we will:

1. Create a file using the terminal and the "touch" command.
    -open the terminal(on the desktop)
    -use the touch command to create a file 
    For example type: touch my_cool_file

2. Edit the file you created in the previous step with a text editor and add an 
    arbitrary message to it.
    For example: edit the file and write "Hello, Science Club!"
    be sure to save the file when you are done.

2. Compile and run 3 example programs provided.  
    The programs are: hello_world.c, primes.c, and fibonacci.c
    -open the terminal(on the desktop)
    -type the "ls" and hit the enter key to list all files in the directory
    -compile the first program hello_world.c with gcc by typing:
      gcc hello_world.c
    -run the hello_world.c program after it has been compiled by typing:
      ./a.out
    -repeat this process for the other two programs: primes.c and fibonacci.c

   
Learning Objects
  You should be able to:
  1. create a file with the terminal/command line
      -learn the "touch" and "ls" commands
  2. edit or modify the file you created with the provided text editor.
  3. compile and run all 3 example programs located in c_playground using gcc
  
Google is your friend! If you do not know how to do something think of a
reasonable query and search for the answer on google. For example you 
could use the following query to solve the first learning objective:
