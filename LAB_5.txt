Lab 4: Operators and Control Structures 

Write a program that calculates prints the following:
   * 1576 x 1234
   *  If the result is greater than (>) 1900000 print word Fizz otherwise print Buzz

Open lab5.c located in c_playground with a text editor
1. Write your program with the above requirements 
2. Save the program 
3. open the terminal(on the desktop)
4. compile the program printf.c with gcc by typing:
     gcc printf.c
5. Run the program
   You are done with the lab
6. If the program fails to compile fix the syntax errors and repeat steps 2-5

When you are done send a screenshot of the source code and output to me in a PRIVATE MESSAGE ON ZOOM 

If you get stuck review the program operators_and_if.c in the c_playground directory for hints.
